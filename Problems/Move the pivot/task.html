<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>In the described implementation of the quicksort, the rightmost element is always chosen as the pivot. In this problem, you need to implement a method called <code class="java">moveThePivot</code> (see the code snippet below) that allows choosing an arbitrary element as the pivot. Keep in mind that the method will be used as a part of the quicksort algorithm, and the final array is expected to be sorted in ascending order.</p>
